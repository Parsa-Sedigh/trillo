/* We want .sidebar(which the navigation is in it) in the left side and .hotel-view on the right side and what is the
perfect tool for doing that? Flexbox.
In order to start using it, we need to set the display prop of flex container to flex. So I gave .content, display of flex.
So .content would be the flex-container for .sidebar and .hotel-view , because .content is the one that HOLDS the two elements
that we want them side by side(which are .sidebar and .hotel-view) and .sidebar and .hotel-view will be our 2 flex-items.

Currently(after giving the .content or the flex-container a display of flex), it's flex-items would now sit NEXT TO EACH
OTHER without setting any other props. So those flex-items are already side by side. Now let's set some props on individual
items.
For that, the .sidebar should have a width and in flex-box the property that we use to define width, is flex-basis prop.
Important: We should always use that flex-basis inside the flex shorthand prop and not on it's own. So instead of using
 flex-basis, we should use flex shorthand prop.
The first value of flex prop, is flex-grow, but in this case for .sidebar , we don't want it to grow, besides the width that
we're going to define, so I gave the first value of flex in .sidebar, 0. We also don't want it to shrink(the second value of
flex, stands for flex-shrink and the next value is flex-basis.)

When flex-grow or the first arg of flex is set to 0, it means we don't want that element to grow if there's some(available)
space but in opposite if we set flex-shrink to 0, we don't want the element to shrink, if there's NOT ENOUGH SPACE(opposite).

When you set the flex-basis or third value of flex to a percentage value, it's actually ok to ALSO write that we don't
want that element to shrink because with that percentage width, it will automatically shrink, because it's width is
a percentage, so it's not like pixel values. So in the case that we have pixel value for width of flex-item, it would be
better to allow it to shrink, but in percentage case, it's good to not allow it.

Now, the .sidebar is 18% width of it's container, but the .hotel-view is still very small. We want the .hotel-view to occupy
the entire remaining width.
Important: In other words (by using flexbox terms) we want it to grow as much as it can. So we give it flex: 1; . So again,
 by using flex: 1; we say that the element should grow as much as it can to take the remaining space(if there's no other item
 with flex-grow or higher flex-grow.)
Now by setting that on .hotel-view, it will now grew all the way to the right side. Therefore it's occupying the remaining
space of it's container which that remaining space is 82%.
With that, the overall header is built.*/

.container {
  /* We used max-width instead of width on this container, with that, it CAN decrease if there's not enough space to show the
  specified value for max-width. So it will show that 120rem, if there's enough space, but if it's not enough space, so if the
  viewport is less than 120rem, then this class will occupy 100% of the available viewport width and that's what max-width
  does.
  So it's a common pattern, to use max-width of the direct childes of <body> which are our containers in general(like
  <section>s that define a whole section of that page and ...).
  Also we want to center it in the viewport(in general, it's parent)(why in the viewport? Because it's the direct
  child of <body>.)

  Also for testing purposes, let's define a min-width and with that we can take a look at our <div> which has this class on
  it.

  Also let's define a variable for this box-shadow because we might reuse this box-shadow in other places too and I named
  that variable shadow-dark.*/
  max-width: 120rem;
  margin: 8rem auto;
  background-color: var(--color-grey-light-1);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-dark);
  min-height: 50rem;
}

.header {
  height: 5rem;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-bottom: var(--color-grey-light-2);
}

.content {
  display: flex;
}

.sidebar {
  background-color: var(--color-grey-dark-1);
  flex: 0 0 18%;
}

.hotel-view {
  background-color: var(--color-grey-light-1);
  flex: 1;
}
